# RNA Visualizer
Raktim Mitra, Jiawei Huang, Bryan Dinh

## Background/Motivation
One of the recent Kaggle challenges was to predict the degradation rates of nucleotides in an RNA molecule. At the time, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines were the most promising candidates for vaccines, but they have issues with degradation (stability). The cut at a nucleotide can make a molecule ineffective. The goal of the competition was to accurately predict the likelihood of each base degrading.

We think that the 3D structure will be informative about the degradation rates of RNA, but these molecules are generally large and difficult to simulate. Instead, we will make use of coarse-grain simulations to overcome this barrier.

![spqrrna](https://github.com/timkartar/cs596_rna_viz/blob/main/example_visualization.png?raw=true)*Static single stranded RNA visualization*

SPQR is a coarse-grain method shown to accurately predict secondary and tertiary structure. It represents each nucleotide as 2 points and focuses on modeling base-base and base-sugar interactions.

## Project
The goal of our project is to visualize the output from such simulation softwares such as SPQR on RNA molecules in parallel to assist in this process. If time permits, we will compare the results of a model trained with the augmented data to one without.

### Available Data
The input (training) data was a set of 3,000 RNA molecules with rates of degradation at each molcule.

Some of the notable fields are:
- id
- sequence
- 2D structure
- predicted loop type
